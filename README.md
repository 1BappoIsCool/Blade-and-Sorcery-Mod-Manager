# Custom Blade & Sorcery Mod Manager
A simple mod manager made to make manual modding of Blade & Sorcery a little less tedious.
# Features
**(WIP)Enabling / Disabling mods** - Allows you to change whether or not a mod gets loaded just by clicking a button.

**(WIP) Drag & Drop installation** - This is planned, will allow you to drag & drop a zip file/files onto the program and have it automatically do the installation for you.
