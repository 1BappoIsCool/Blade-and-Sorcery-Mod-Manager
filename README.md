# Features
Uses a SQLite database to store the relevant info of any mods you have currently installed.

**(WIP)Enabling / Disabling mods** - About 60% done, persistency is something that needs work. - Allows you to change whether or not a mod gets loaded just by clicking a button.

**Drag & Drop installation** - Simply drag & drop a zip file/files onto the program and have it automatically do the installation for you.
